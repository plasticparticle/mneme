# Relay HTTP API

The relay (`journald`) is a small JSON-over-HTTP service. Binary fields are **standard base64**
(Go `StdEncoding`); `owner_id` / `device_id` are **base64url without padding** (`sha256(pubkey)`).
Authenticated routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and are strictly scoped to the session's
`owner_id`. Base URL in dev: `http://localhost:8080` (client override: `VITE_RELAY_URL`).

See [ARCHITECTURE.md §6](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the call sequence and [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for
the auth model.

## Auth

### `POST /v1/register`
The device signs `"mneme:register:" || ownerPub || devicePub` (Ed25519) to prove key possession.
```jsonc
// request
{ "owner_pubkey": "<base64 X25519, 32B>",
  "device_pubkey": "<base64 Ed25519, 32B>",
  "signature":     "<base64 Ed25519 sig>" }
// 200
{ "owner_id": "<base64url>", "device_id": "<base64url>" }
```

### `POST /v1/auth/challenge`
```jsonc
{ "device_id": "<base64url>" }
// 200 — challenge is single-use, expires in 2 minutes
{ "challenge": "<base64>", "expires_at": "RFC3339" }
```

### `POST /v1/auth/verify`
```jsonc
{ "device_id": "<base64url>",
  "challenge": "<base64 from /challenge>",
  "signature": "<base64 Ed25519 sig over challenge bytes>" }
// 200 — token TTL defaults to 24h; server stores only sha256(token)
{ "token": "<opaque>", "owner_id": "<base64url>", "expires_at": "RFC3339" }
```

---

## Sync

### `POST /v1/sync/push`
Last-write-wins per entry on `lww_clock`. The server treats `ciphertext` as opaque bytes.
```jsonc
{ "entries": [
    { "entry_id": "<random hex>",
      "lww_clock": 1717900000000,
      "ciphertext": "<base64 of [version][nonce][ct+tag]>",
      "deleted": false }
] }
// 200 — applied=false means a not-newer clock was ignored
{ "results": [ { "entry_id": "...", "applied": true } ] }
```

### `POST /v1/sync/pull`
```jsonc
{ "since": 0, "limit": 500 }
// 200 — cursor = max seq returned; when cursor == since you're caught up
{ "entries": [
    { "entry_id": "...", "lww_clock": 1717900000000,
      "ciphertext": "<base64>", "deleted": false, "seq": 42 }
  ],
  "cursor": 42,
  "more": false }
```

---

## Reminders

`fire_at` is **cleartext** (an accepted leak — the scheduler needs it; the entry stays encrypted).

```jsonc
// PUT /v1/reminders
{ "reminder_id": "...", "fire_at": "RFC3339" }   // 200 { "reminder_id": "..." }

// GET /v1/reminders  →  200
{ "reminders": [ { "reminder_id": "...", "fire_at": "RFC3339", "dispatched": false } ] }

// DELETE /v1/reminders/{id}  →  204 No Content
```

---

## Media

Server-relayed, chunked, client-encrypted (§6/§10 step 5; see `internal/blobs`). The client splits
a recording into ~1 MiB plaintext chunks, seals each one independently under the media key
(`[version][nonce:24][ct+tag]`, AAD binds media id + chunk position), and uploads them one by one.
The relay streams chunks to S3/MinIO under `media/{owner_id}/{media_id}/{n}` and stores only
`(media_id, bytes, chunks)` in Postgres. Which entry a media object belongs to — and its mime type,
duration, and plaintext size — travels inside the *encrypted entry body* (`attachments` list), so
the relay learns nothing beyond the random id and ciphertext sizes.

```jsonc
// PUT /v1/media/{id}/chunks/{n}    body: raw octet-stream (one encrypted chunk, ≤2 MiB)
{ "media_id": "…", "chunk": 0 }

// POST /v1/media/{id}/complete
{ "chunks": 2, "bytes": 1049892 }       // ciphertext totals; → { "media_id": "…" }

// GET /v1/media/{id}  →  200
{ "media_id": "…", "bytes": 1049892, "chunks": 2 }

// GET /v1/media/{id}/chunks/{n}  →  200 octet-stream (the encrypted chunk)

// DELETE /v1/media/{id}  →  204
```

`{id}` must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{16,64}` (clients use random 128-bit hex — never date-encoded).
Without `S3_ENDPOINT` configured the media endpoints answer `503`; clients keep recordings queued
locally and retry. Re-uploading the same media id is idempotent.

`DELETE` removes the Postgres index row first, then best-effort-deletes the S3 chunks (a failure
there only orphans ciphertext nothing references). It is **idempotent** — deleting an unknown or
already-deleted id answers `204` — because clients queue deletions while offline (the local
`media_tombstones` table) and retry until acknowledged.

---

## Account

### `DELETE /v1/account` → `204 No Content`

Deletes **everything** stored for the authenticated owner: entry blobs, the media index and its S3
chunks, reminders, push subscriptions, devices, and all sessions (including the one making the
request). There is no request body and no undo.

This is the server half of **recovery-phrase rotation** (`apps/client/src/sync/rotate.ts`): because
`owner_id` and all keys are derived from the mnemonic, a phrase can't be changed in place — the
client derives a fresh identity from a new phrase, re-encrypts and re-pushes the whole vault as a
brand-new owner, and only then calls this endpoint with the *old* session token. Afterwards the old
phrase still passes TOFU registration (it's just a keypair) but opens an empty vault.

---

## Admin

Disabled by default: every `/admin` path is a plain 404 until the `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable
is set. The admin surface is for the **operator** and shows **aggregates and storage metadata only** —
exactly what the relay already stores as accepted metadata (see SECURITY.md). It cannot show content
or identities, because the data to do so does not exist server-side.

### `GET /admin`

The dashboard page (self-contained HTML, no external assets). The page asks for the admin token in
the browser and calls `/admin/stats` with it; the token is kept in `sessionStorage` only.

### `GET /admin/stats` → `200`

Requires `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>` (constant-time compared; wrong token → 401).

```json
{
  "totals":  { "vaults": 4, "devices": 6, "records": 120, "record_bytes": 51234,
               "media_objects": 9, "media_bytes": 20801466 },
  "vaults":  [ { "vault": "GGnnHixG…", "created_at": "…", "devices": 1,
                 "records": 4, "record_bytes": 6798,
                 "media_objects": 6, "media_bytes": 16599319, "last_activity": "…" } ],
  "daily":   [ { "day": "2026-06-12", "counts": { "requests": 23, "requests_failed": 2,
                 "records_created": 2, "media_uploaded": 1, "media_bytes": 1048576,
                 "vaults_created": 3, "vaults_deleted": 1 } } ],
  "runtime": { "started_at": "…", "uptime_seconds": 45, "requests": 23,
               "failed_4xx": 1, "failed_5xx": 1, "avg_latency_ms": 2.3, "max_latency_ms": 10.1 }
}
```

- `vaults` — per-vault storage footprint from the existing bookkeeping tables. `vault` is a
  *truncated* opaque pubkey hash (pseudonymous by construction, never an identity).
- `daily` — the last 30 days from the `usage_daily` table, which has **no owner column by design**:
  daily activity can never be attributed to a vault. Counters are buffered in memory and flushed
  every 30 s (plus once on graceful shutdown), so up to 30 s of counts can be lost on a crash.
  Only `/v1/*` traffic counts as a request — health probes and admin polling are excluded.
- `runtime` — since-process-start health figures (kept in memory, reset on restart).

Honest limits of an E2EE relay: "records" are encrypted oplog rows — entries, templates, journal
metadata and AI-settings records are **indistinguishable** on purpose (the record kind lives inside
the ciphertext). "Journals created" is not measurable at all — journal metadata syncs under a random
wire id with the journal's identity inside the ciphertext — and media kinds (video/audio/image/file)
are unknowable — the mime type never reaches the relay.

### `DELETE /admin/vaults/{id}` → `204 No Content`

Operator-initiated vault wipe (e.g. reclaiming storage from an abandoned vault). `{id}` is the full
`owner_id` from `/admin/stats`. The body **must** be `{"confirm":"delete"}` — the typed confirmation
is enforced server-side (400 without it), not just in the dashboard UI, so a stray request with a
valid admin token cannot destroy a vault. 404 when the vault doesn't exist (or is already gone).

Destroys exactly what self-service `DELETE /v1/account` destroys: entry blobs, the media index and
its S3 chunks, reminders, push subscriptions, devices, and sessions. It does **not** reach into any
device's local copy — the relay has no access to clients, by design — and the same recovery phrase
can re-register afterwards as an empty vault (TOFU). The dashboard exposes this per vault row behind
a type-"delete" modal.

Authorization note: vault deletion is two strictly separated capabilities. A **user session** can
only ever delete its own vault — `DELETE /v1/account` takes no vault id; the owner comes from the
authenticated session. The **admin token** is required to delete by id; without it, `/admin/vaults/*`
answers 401 (or 404 when the admin surface is disabled) before any lookup happens.

### Backups & disaster recovery

Enabled when `BACKUP_DIR` is set (otherwise the endpoints answer 503, and the scheduled worker is
off). A backup is a single gzipped tar of **every vault's opaque ciphertext** — the bookkeeping tables
as NDJSON plus the client-encrypted media chunks. It contains **no keys and no plaintext** (the relay
never has any), so an archive is exactly as sensitive as the relay's own storage and changes nothing
about the E2EE guarantees (see SECURITY.md §6). `sessions` and `auth_challenges` are deliberately
excluded — they are short-lived secrets that must not be resurrected from an old archive.

Layout: `manifest.json` (format version, timestamp, schema version, row counts), `db/*.ndjson` (one
file per table, base64 for `bytea` columns), `media/<owner_id>/<media_id>/<n>` (raw chunk bytes).

`GET /admin/backups` → `200` — service status plus the stored archive listing:

```json
{
  "enabled": true, "dir": "/backups", "keep": 7, "running": false,
  "last_name": "mneme-backup-20260614T203954Z.tar.gz", "last_at": "2026-06-14T20:39:54Z",
  "last_error": "",
  "backups": [ { "name": "mneme-backup-20260614T203954Z.tar.gz", "bytes": 1003,
                 "created_at": "2026-06-14T20:39:54Z" } ],
  "total_bytes": 1003
}
```

`POST /admin/backups` → `202` — start a backup. The write can be slow on a large media set, so it
runs **detached**; poll `GET /admin/backups` for the new archive (or `last_error`). 409 if one is
already running, 503 if backups are disabled. Archives are written to a `.partial` file and renamed
on success, so a crash mid-write never leaves a truncated archive that looks complete. The newest
`BACKUP_KEEP` archives are retained (0 = keep all).

`GET /admin/backups/{name}` → `200` (`application/gzip`) — download one archive. `{name}` must be a
literal archive filename (`^mneme-backup-\d{8}T\d{6}Z\.tar\.gz$`); anything else → 400, the security
boundary against path traversal. The dashboard downloads via an authenticated fetch (never a token in
the URL — admin paths are logged).

`DELETE /admin/backups/{name}` → `204` — remove one archive (does not touch vault data).

`POST /admin/backups/{name}/restore` → `200` — **disaster recovery**. Body **must** be
`{"confirm":"restore"}` (enforced server-side, 400 without it). This **replaces all relay data** with
the archive's contents in one transaction (truncate-and-replay; a failure leaves the existing data
untouched), then re-uploads the media chunks to object storage. The response echoes the restored
manifest counts. Sessions are cleared, so every device re-authenticates on next sync. An archive whose
schema version is newer than the running binary is refused — upgrade `journald` first.

The **recommended** path for real DR is the CLI (`journald restore <archive>`): it runs against a
stopped or freshly-provisioned server, which is the usual state when recovering. See README/§Commands.
