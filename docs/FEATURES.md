# Features

Everything Mneme can do **today**, in one place. If it's listed here without a caveat, it's built and
working in the browser app right now — not a mockup, not a "coming soon," not a slide in a pitch deck.
Things that are genuinely not done yet live in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md), clearly labelled, because
pretending otherwise would be exactly the kind of behaviour this project exists to avoid.

Everything below happens **on your device**. Entries, media, templates, and settings are encrypted
before they ever touch the network, and the server — bless its clueless little heart — only ever sees
opaque ciphertext. See [ENCRYPTION.md](./ENCRYPTION.md) if you'd like to watch how the sausage is
cryptographically made.

## Writing

A real editor, not a glorified `<textarea>`.

- **Rich-text editor** (TipTap / ProseMirror) with a calm Zen writing surface — serif body text, a
  quiet toolbar that stays out of your way, and a `/` slash palette so you can insert anything without
  the indignity of reaching for the mouse.
- **Structured content** — headings, bullet/numbered lists, **checklists / tasks**, blockquotes,
  **resizable tables**, and **code blocks with syntax highlighting** (auto-detected grammars, with a
  warm-paper light theme and a dark variant).
- **Math typesetting** — type `$$x^2$$` inline or `$$$ … $$$` for a display block; formulas render
  with KaTeX and reopen in a live-preview LaTeX editor when you click them. The LaTeX source is
  surfaced to search and previews, so your equations are findable, not just pretty.
- **Cross-entry links with backlinks** — type `[[` to link to another entry. Each entry grows a
  "Linked from" list of everything that references it, quietly turning your journal into a little web
  of thought. Renames heal themselves; deleted targets render as polite muted chips rather than
  breaking.
- **Editable date & time per entry** — backdate, re-date, time-travel freely. Because the date rides
  *inside* the encrypted body, moving it around leaks precisely nothing to the server.
- **Labels** with autocomplete, and **multiple notebooks** ("journals") to keep your dream diary and
  your tax anxieties in separate rooms.

## Media (all end-to-end encrypted, chunked, and synced)

- **Photos & image galleries** — drop images in; consecutive ones group into a gallery and open in a
  keyboard-navigable lightbox.
- **Video & audio recording** straight from the editor via your camera and microphone. No upload to
  anyone's "cloud studio," no terms of service granting a perpetual worldwide licence to your face.
- **File attachments** of any kind.
- **Location & travel maps** — pin a single place or a from→to journey, with an optional travel photo.
  The map is rendered **once** into a frozen image at insert time, so opening the entry later makes
  *zero* further calls to any map service. (The one, clearly-labelled, opt-in-per-insert exception is
  the address lookup at creation time — see
  [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md#location-snapshots--a-one-time-per-insert-exception).)

## Organising & finding

- **Vault-wide search** (⌘/Ctrl+K, plus a sidebar field, a mobile nav entry, and a bar on the journals
  screen) across titles, bodies, labels, and date spellings. Substring for now; a proper full-text
  index is [waiting on a wasm build](./ROADMAP.md) rather than on anyone's good intentions.
- **Calendar** with month, year, and timeline views, plus a writing **heatmap** so you can feel gently
  judged by your own consistency.
- **Writing stats** — totals, streaks, and days journaled, all computed locally over your decrypted
  entries. Nobody else is counting.
- **Templates** — built-in starters (Experiment log, Study notes, and friends) *and* your own, fully
  editable and deletable. They sync as encrypted blobs; the server can't tell a template from an entry,
  which is rather the point.

## The AI assistant (optional, off by default, private by design)

The assistant can both **read** and **write** in your journal — and it is **never** routed through the
Mneme server. Requests go straight from your device to a model of your choosing. The **recommended**
choice is a local model (e.g. Gemma via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)), in which case your most
private thoughts help you *and never leave your computer*.

- **Ask my journal** — question-and-answer grounded in your own entries.
- **Editor writing help** — Continue, Summarize, or Suggest-a-title for the current entry, always with
  a confirm-before-it-inserts step.
- **Guided interviews** — the assistant asks one reflective question at a time, then drafts a full
  entry for you to review and save. It remembers previous entries of the same kind, so a recurring
  "daily reflection" stays continuous. There's also a one-line **freeform draft** mode.
- **Interview types** — built-in and user-created, synced like templates.

You *can* point it at a cloud model instead (bring your own Anthropic API key). It's more capable, and
the trade-off is stated plainly on the settings screen: for each request, the context entries are
decrypted and sent over HTTPS to that provider. Your key is sealed at rest under a key derived from
your recovery phrase, and the AI settings sync to your other devices as an encrypted record. The
server still can't read or use the key. Full analysis in
[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md#the-opt-in-ai-assistant--a-deliberate-user-consented-exception).

## Import

- **Day One import** — feed it a Day One JSON export `.zip` and it rebuilds the whole thing locally as
  encrypted entries: journals become notebooks, media is re-encrypted and attached, original dates and
  tags are preserved. The zip never leaves your device. (Other formats and a proper export are on the
  [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md).)

## Make it yours

- **A dozen languages** — the whole UI is localized into English, German, Spanish, French, Italian,
  Dutch, Finnish, Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese, with proper `Intl` date/number
  formatting and pluralization. Arabic flips the entire document to **RTL** (`<html dir="rtl">`, logical
  CSS throughout). Pick a language in Preferences → Appearance; like the theme, it's device-local and
  never synced.
- **Six theme skins** — Paper, Modern, Terminal, Forest, Blossom, Lavender — each with a full light and
  dark variant, times **six accent tints**. Light / dark / system. All stored device-locally and never
  synced, because your taste in colours is nobody's business but yours.
- **Responsive shell** — a three-pane desktop layout above 920px, a mobile layout with bottom
  navigation below it.

## Security & lifecycle (the load-bearing features)

- **Recovery-phrase login** — a 12-word BIP39 phrase *is* your account. No email, no password, no
  "create account" funnel harvesting your details.
- **Stay-signed-in, done properly** — opt in to seal your seed on the device under either an
  **Argon2id passphrase** or a **FIDO2 / WebAuthn security key** (YubiKey, platform passkey). Switch
  between passphrase ⇄ security key ⇄ off in Preferences → Vault. A **15-minute inactivity auto-lock**
  and a manual **Lock journal** control keep an unattended device honest.
- **Recovery-phrase rotation** — if you fear your phrase leaked, "Replace recovery phrase" re-encrypts
  your entire vault under a fresh phrase and new identity, then wipes the old one. The leaked phrase is
  left unlocking an empty vault. (Details in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).)
- **Deletion that actually deletes** — entry, journal, and whole-vault deletion, each behind an
  explicit (and for the scary ones, type-the-word) confirmation, propagated to the server and every
  other device.
- **Offline-first** — the real database lives on *your* device. Lose the network and you keep writing;
  it syncs when it can. The vault chip just shrugs and says "offline."
- **Installable** — served over HTTPS, Mneme installs to your home screen or dock as a Progressive Web
  App: its own window, offline-capable, no app store. ([How to install](./PWA.md).)

## For the operator (if you self-host the relay)

- **Admin dashboard** (`/admin`, disabled until you set `ADMIN_TOKEN`) — per-vault storage footprints
  (keyed by pseudonymous hashes, never names) and owner-less daily aggregate counters. It shows
  **health and growth, never people**, because the data to identify anyone simply isn't there.
- **Operator vault deletion** — wipe a vault by id, behind a typed `"delete"` confirmation.
- **Backups & disaster recovery** — one gzipped archive of every vault's ciphertext (no keys, no
  plaintext), via the dashboard *or* the `journald backup` / `restore` / `list-backups` CLI. See
  [MAINTENANCE.md](./MAINTENANCE.md).
- **Update awareness** — the dashboard checks the running build against the latest GitHub release
  (`/admin/version`) and quietly tells you when a newer one exists. Tagged releases (`v*`) build and
  publish a Docker image automatically via GitHub Actions.
